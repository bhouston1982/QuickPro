REM The entries in this section both dictate the  names of files and will propagate various metadata additions,
REM so it's important to set them correctly. All accession directories are assumed to be found in
REM H:\departments\archives\E-recs-unprocessed\, and the accession number is derived from the first 8
REM characters of the folder name. If a folder does not have an accession number, assign a dummy 
REM number for the sake of correct input.


REM If you are one of my lovely testers outside of UWM, you'll need to change 
REM the locations of the various programs and scripts being called here. In general, 
REM when you see a path along the lines of "H:\Departments\Archives\E-recs-unprocessed\
REM or "H:\Departments\Archives\E-records workspace", you should delete that and put in 
REM your own path to the file being called. (If you can put those programs in your SYSTEM 
REM path, even better... but I don't know how to do that).

REM This step creates a DROID profile in the e-records unprocessed base directory for the accession, from

REM or other sensitive information. This can be done either by viewing the text files in the
REM \BE_Reports directory, or by viewing the report.xml file in Bulk_Extractor Viewer
REM (Recommended for processors not familiar with the structure of a Bulk_Extractor report).
